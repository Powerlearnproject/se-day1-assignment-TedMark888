#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that is concerned with the systematic analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance of software systems.Software engineering, aims for the production of high quality, reliable, scalable software, the backbone of the entire technology industry, the basis of all innovation, economic growth, and not to mention the smooth operation of modern society as a whole

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The advent of high level programming languages(1950s-1960s)The development of high-level programming languages like FORTRAN marked a significant shift from machine code and assembly languages. These "languages" enabled the coders to write in almost plain English, and therefore made programming easier to do and less likely to have mistakes.
Introduction of the Software Development Lifecycle models(1970s-1980s)The 1970s saw the formalization of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), with models such as the Waterfall model becoming widely adopted. These models provided a more structured methodology to building software, with an emphisis on distinct phases like requirements gathering, design, coding, testing, and maintenance.The introduction of SDLC models brought discipline to the software development process, ensuring that projects were more predictable and manageable.
The rise of Agile Methodologies(1990s-present)Agile methodologies emerged in the 90's as a response to issues with more old fashion, structured development models like waterfall. Agile promotes iterative development, continual feedback, and the collaboration of cross-functional teams

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning & Analysis: Requirements are gathered by the team from stakeholders. They evaluate feasibility, revenue potential, costs and user needs.
Requirements Definition: Detailed requirements are documented. The team specifies what the software should do, its features and functionality.
Design: Here, a blueprint for the software is created. It includes high-level design and low level design.
Development: Developers write code based on the developer specifications. Actual software product is created.
Testing: Many tests are done to ensure that the software meets quality standards. Includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
Deployment: The software to production environments. This phase involves installation, configuration, and making the software available to end-users.
Maintenance and Support: Ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and updates are performed. Support teams address user issues and ensure the software runs smoothly.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology is a traditional project management approach that follow a linear  and seqential process. While Agile Methodology, is a modern and flexible approach that emphasizes iterative development and collaboration.For waterfall methodology, constructing a building or developing a software system for regulatory compliance, where the requirements are clear and fixed. For Agile methodology, developing a new software application where user needs and market conditions may change frequently.Waterfall is best for projects with clear, stable requirements, while Agile is suited for projects that need flexibility and continuous improvement.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer  Role: Write code that makes the software work.    Responsibilities:      Coding; Develop and maintain software applications.      Debugging; Fix bugs and issues in the code.      Collaboration; Work with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to create software solutions.      Testing; Perform initial tests to ensure the software works as expected.
Quality Assurance Engineer  Role: Ensure the software is of high quality and works correctly.    Responsibilities:      Testing; Conduct various tests to find bugs and issues.       Reporting; Document and report any problems found during testing.       Verification; Ensures that the software meets the requirements and standards.       Collaboration; Work with developers to understand issues and help fix them.
Project Manager  Role: They oversee the project to ensure it is completed on time and within the budget.    Responsibilities:      Planning; Create project plans, timelines, and schedules.      Coordination; Coordinate tasks and resources among team members.      Communication; Act as a bridge between team and stakeholders, providing updates and managing expectations.      Risk Management; Identify potential risks and develop strategies to mitigate them.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide a single place to write, test, and debug code, making the development process faster and more efficient for example Visual Studio Code. While Version Control Systems allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Debugging issues: Use debugging tools to write clear, well-documented code to make it easier to identify and fix bugs.Tight 
Deadlines: Breaking tasks into smaller, manageable chunks and use project management tools to keep track of progress and deadlines.
Keeping up with technology: Dedicate time for continuous learning through online courses, workshops, and reading industry blogs.
Security threats: Follow best practices to secure coding, conduct regular security audits, and stay informed about the latest security threats

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Testing pieces of code to ensure they work correctly on their own. It helps catch bugs early in the development process.
Integration Testing: Testing how different components or modules of software to work together. This ensures combined parts of the application function correctly and interact as expected, preventing issues when the system is put together.
System Testing: Testing the complete and integrated software to verify that it meets the specified requirements. It checks the whole system’s functionality, performance, and security, ensuring the software works as a complete package.
Acceptance Testing: Testing the software from the user’s perspective to ensure it meets their needs and requirements. This validates that the software is ready for release and that it delivers the expected value to the users.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining questions or instructions to get the specific and useful responses from AI models.    Importance in Interacting with AI Models       Well constructed prompts help AI models understand exactly what one is asking, leading to a more accurate and relevant responses.       Good prompts reduce the need for multiple attempts to get the desired answer, saving time and effort.       Thoughtful prompt engineering can minimize biases in AI responses by guiding the model to consider diverse perspectives.       By fin tuning prompts, one can make AI models more reliable and effective in various applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Tell me about climate change. Improved prompt; “Explain the main causes of climate change and its impact on coastal cities, using recent scientific data and examples from the last five years.”The improved prompt is more effective since its asks for specific information, it requests the use of recent scientific data and examples from the last five years thus showing clarity. It also directs AI to provide detailed and up-to-date information thus showing focus.
